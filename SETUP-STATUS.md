# vLLM Nanonets-OCR Setup - Current Status

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

---

## Overview

Your secure vLLM Nanonets-OCR deployment is now **working correctly** with proper network isolation and API access through an nginx gateway.

## Current Configuration

### Architecture
```
Windows Host (localhost:8001)
    ↓
Nginx Gateway (vllm-nginx-gateway)
    • Port 8001:80 exposed to host
    • Connected to TWO networks:
      - default (bridge) → Allows port exposure
      - vllm-internal (internal) → Talks to vLLM
    ↓
vLLM Container (vllm-nanonets-ocr)
    • NO exposed ports
    • Connected to ONE network:
      - vllm-internal (internal) → NO internet access
    • Loads model from volume
```

### Network Security ✅

| Component | Internet Access | Exposed Ports | Security Status |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **vLLM Container** | ❌ BLOCKED | ❌ None | ✅ Fully Isolated |
| **Nginx Gateway** | ✅ Has Access* | ✅ Port 8001 | ✅ Acts as Boundary |
| **Model Storage** | N/A (Volume) | N/A | ✅ Persistent |

*Nginx has internet access but doesn't route it to vLLM containers

### Verified Working ✅

1. **Port Exposure:**
   ```
   $ docker inspect vllm-nginx-gateway --format "{{json .NetworkSettings.Ports}}"
   {"80/tcp":[{"HostIp":"0.0.0.0","HostPort":"8001"}]}
   ```
   ✅ Port 8001 is bound and accessible

2. **API Access:**
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8001/health
   # Status: 200 OK
   
   curl http://localhost:8001/v1/models
   # Returns: nanonets/Nanonets-OCR2-3B model info
   ```
   ✅ API is accessible from Windows host

3. **Network Isolation:**
   ```bash
   $ docker exec vllm-nanonets-ocr python3 -c "import socket; ..."
   Internet BLOCKED
   ```
   ✅ vLLM container cannot access internet

4. **Internal Communication:**
   ```bash
   $ docker exec vllm-nginx-gateway curl http://vllm-nanonets-ocr:8000/health
   # Success
   ```
   ✅ Nginx can reach vLLM on internal network

## What Was Wrong

### The Problem

The nginx gateway was configured **only** on the `vllm-internal` network, which has `internal: true`. Docker's security feature **blocks port exposure** from containers that are exclusively on internal networks, even if ports are configured in docker-compose.yml.

**Symptoms:**
- Port 8001 was configured but not accessible
- `curl http://localhost:8001` → "Unable to connect"
- `docker inspect` showed empty port bindings: `{"80/tcp":[]}`

### Root Cause

```yaml
# BEFORE (didn't work)
nginx-gateway:
  networks:
    - vllm-internal  # ONLY internal network
  ports:
    - "8001:80"  # Configured but BLOCKED by Docker
```

Docker prevented port exposure because:
1. Container only connected to internal network
2. Internal networks block ALL external connectivity (including port binding)
3. Security by design: prevents accidental exposure

### The Solution

Added the default bridge network to nginx-gateway:

```yaml
# AFTER (working now)
nginx-gateway:
  networks:
    - default        # Allows port exposure to host
    - vllm-internal  # Can talk to vLLM containers
  ports:
    - "8001:80"  # Now works!
```

**Why this is secure:**
- vLLM container: Still isolated (only on internal network)
- Nginx gateway: Acts as security boundary between external and internal
- Architecture: Matches vLLM's official nginx deployment pattern

## Current Services Status

```bash
$ docker-compose ps
```

| Service | Status | Networks | Ports | Internet |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| vllm-nanonets-ocr | ✅ Running | vllm-internal | None exposed | ❌ Blocked |
| vllm-nginx-gateway | ✅ Running | default + vllm-internal | 8001:80 | ✅ Has access |
| vllm-openai-api | ⚠️ Running* | vllm-external | 8000:8000 | ✅ Has access |

*Legacy service (can be stopped if not needed)

## API Endpoints

All endpoints accessible at: **http://localhost:8001**

### Health & Status
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /v1/models` - List available models
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

### OCR API (OpenAI-compatible)
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` - Chat completions (with vision)
- `POST /v1/completions` - Text completions

### Example Request

```powershell
# PowerShell
$headers = @{
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}

$body = @{
    model = "nanonets/Nanonets-OCR2-3B"
    messages = @(
        @{
            role = "user"
            content = @(
                @{
                    type = "text"
                    text = "Extract text from this image"
                },
                @{
                    type = "image_url"
                    image_url = @{
                        url = "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ..."
                    }
                }
            )
        }
    )
    max_tokens = 2000
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8001/v1/chat/completions" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body
```

## Next Steps

### To Test OCR Functionality

1. **Prepare test image** (in `examples/sample_documents/`)

2. **Run test script:**
   ```powershell
   # From PowerShell in vLLM directory
   python scripts\nanonets-ocr-example.py --mode api --image examples\sample_documents\test.jpg
   ```

3. **Or use curl/Invoke-RestMethod** (see example above)

### To Connect LlamaIndex

Your LlamaIndex container can connect via:
```python
# In LlamaIndex container
openai.base_url = "http://vllm-nginx-gateway:80/v1"
# OR from Windows
openai.base_url = "http://localhost:8001/v1"
```

**To connect containers:**
```bash
# Connect LlamaIndex network to vLLM default network
docker network connect vllm_default <llamaindex-container-name>
```

### To Monitor

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f vllm-nanonets-ocr
docker-compose logs -f nginx-gateway

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# View metrics
curl http://localhost:8001/metrics
```

## Troubleshooting

### If port 8001 stops working

1. Check nginx is on both networks:
   ```bash
   docker inspect vllm-nginx-gateway --format "{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}"
   ```
   Should show: `default` AND `vllm-internal`

2. Recreate container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d nginx-gateway
   ```

### If vLLM not responding

1. Check container status:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps vllm-nanonets-ocr
   ```

2. View logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs --tail 100 vllm-nanonets-ocr
   ```

3. Test internal health:
   ```bash
   docker exec vllm-nginx-gateway curl http://vllm-nanonets-ocr:8000/health
   ```

### If internet access detected on vLLM

This would be a security issue. Verify:
```bash
docker inspect vllm-nanonets-ocr --format "{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}"
```
Should **ONLY** show `vllm-internal`, nothing else.
